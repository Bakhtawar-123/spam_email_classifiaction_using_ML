# Introduction:
I recently completed a data science project focused on spam email classification. The objective was to build a model that could accurately distinguish between spam and legitimate emails. In this post, I will walk you through the steps I followed, from data preparation to model training, using the Naive Bayes classifier. The project yielded impressive results, achieving an accuracy of 98%. Let's dive into the details!

# Data Preparation:
To start, I performed data preparation tasks to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis. I began by dropping unnecessary columns that did not contribute to the classification task. Additionally, I renamed certain columns to make them more understandable. Lastly, I checked for any null values in the dataset, ensuring that the data was clean and complete.

# Data Visualization:
After data preparation, I proceeded with data visualization to gain insights into the distribution of the classes or unique values of the target label. Visualizing the data helped me understand the balance between spam and legitimate emails and provided valuable context for subsequent steps in the project.

# Feature Extraction and Target:
With the data prepared and visualized, I moved on to feature extraction and target definition. Feature extraction involved selecting relevant attributes or features from the dataset that would help the model make accurate predictions. Simultaneously, I defined the target variable, which in this case was the classification of an email as either spam or legitimate.

# Model Training:
For this project, I chose the Naive Bayes classifier as it is well-suited for text classification tasks like spam email detection. I trained the model using the prepared dataset, features, and target. The Naive Bayes classifier leverages probabilistic principles to classify new instances based on observed patterns in the training data. Through iterative training and fine-tuning, I achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, indicating the effectiveness of the model in distinguishing between spam and legitimate emails.

# Conclusion:
In conclusion, I successfully completed a data science project focused on spam email classification using the Naive Bayes classifier. By diligently performing data preparation, visualizing the dataset, conducting feature extraction, and training the model, I achieved an accuracy of 98%. The results demonstrate the potential of the Naive Bayes classifier in efficiently detecting spam emails. I am thrilled with the outcome of this project and look forward to applying these techniques to other real-world problems. 
# Happy coding!
